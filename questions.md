<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>

Wireframes help with the design process by providing a visual representation of the layout and functionality of a website or application before any actual coding or design work is done. This allows designers and stakeholders to quickly iterate on and refine the design, catching potential issues early on in the process and saving time and resources in the long run.

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>

User testing plays a crucial role in the design of user interfaces and wireframes in computer science. It involves gathering feedback from users to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the design, and making adjustments based on that feedback.An example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design is the redesign of the healthcare.gov website in the United States.

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>

It provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript code that makes it easy to create consistent and professional-looking web pages.

<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>

One of the main benefits of using Bootstrap in web development is that it allows developers to save time and effort by providing pre-built CSS classes and JavaScript plugins for common UI components such as forms, buttons, and navigation menus. This can result in faster development times and more consistent designs.

<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>

<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>

Selectors are used in CSS to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. One example of a selector is the class selector, which targets HTML elements based on their class attribute. For example, the selector ".button" would target all HTML elements with the class "button" and apply any CSS styles defined for that class.

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>

In the snake game, selection is used to detect when the snake collides with itself. Iteration is used to update the position of the snake and to check if it has collided with the food. Sequencing is used to ensure that the game logic is executed in the correct order, such as checking for collisions before updating the snake's position.

<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>

":root" is a CSS pseudo-class that refers to the root element of the document, which in the case of an HTML document is the html element. In the snake game, ":root" is used to define CSS variables that can be used throughout the game, such as the size of the game board and the colors used for the snake and food.

<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>

HTML is used to define the structure and content of the web page, CSS is used to define the visual styling and layout, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page. Together, these three technologies allow developers to create rich and engaging web applications that can run in a web browser.
